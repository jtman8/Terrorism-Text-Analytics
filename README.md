# Terrorism-Text-Analytics
For this project, I used exploratory text analytics techniques to compare themes, organizations, and people between ISIS and Al-Qaeda. The code is in the format of a Jupyter Notebook, so I walk through the code and context of the project in the notebook itself. To get an overview of what the project is about, the project proposal is provided. This proposal includes methodological information, details about where the data come from, and what specific analyses our team completed. The Web Based Visualization on my Github Pages (https://www.jtman8.github.io/) extends the analysis to identify emotions of each group as they relates to references of specific individuals using SpaCy's Entity Recognition functionality. This included clustering individuals based on their emotional profile and a lot of Entity Resolution to ensure people were not duplicated in their references.
